üï∏Ô∏è Web Scraping & Encryption Report

1. Description of the Website Scraped
- Website: Books to Scrape
- Purpose: A mock e-commerce site designed for practicing web scraping. It contains book listings with metadata such as title, price, and rating.
- Content Type: Publicly available HTML pages listing books in a catalog format.

2. Fields Extracted
- Title: Extracted from the `title` attribute of the book anchor tag.
- Price: Retrieved from the `.price_color` CSS class.
- Rating: Parsed from the `class` attribute of the `p.star-rating` tag (e.g., "Three", "Five").

3. Security Approach Used
- User-Agent Spoofing: A standard browser user-agent string (`Mozilla/5.0`) was used to avoid bot detection.
- Rate Limiting: A `time.sleep(1)` delay was added between page requests to reduce server load and mimic human browsing.
- Encryption:
  - Library Used: `cryptography.fernet`
  - Key Generation: A symmetric key was generated and stored in `secret.key`.
  - File Encryption: The `books.csv` file was encrypted into `books_encrypted.bin`.
  - Decryption: The encrypted file was decrypted back into `books_decrypted.csv` for verification.

4. Ethical Considerations
- ‚úÖ robots.txt Respect: The site is explicitly built for scraping practice, and its `robots.txt` allows crawling.
- ‚úÖ Scraping Limits: Only 2 pages were scraped, with respectful delays.
- ‚úÖ No Authentication Required: All data was publicly accessible.
- ‚úÖ No Commercial Use: Data was used for educational purposes only.
- ‚úÖ Transparency: Encryption ensures data security and integrity during storage and transmission.
